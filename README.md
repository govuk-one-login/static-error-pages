# Outage Explanation Page

This repository serves a static index.html page that provides an explanation for outages in the GOV.UK OneLogin journey.

In instances where the frontend services are inaccessible or down for any reason, users may encounter a generic Cloudfront error page. To address this, this repository hosts a custom error page to provide users with information about the outage.
